# Social Media Platform API

This project is a Node.js-powered backend API for a social media platform where users can create posts, comment, like, and receive real-time notifications. It also includes a Kafka integration for event-driven architecture and a rate-limiting system to control user activity.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login and signup with JWT-based authentication.
- **Posts & Comments**: Users can create, edit, and delete posts. Comments can be added to posts with a rate limiter to control excessive commenting.
- **Likes**: Users can like or unlike posts, with real-time notifications sent using Kafka.
- **Notifications**: Kafka is used to publish and consume notifications for user actions like likes and comments.
- **Rate Limiting**: Rate limiting is implemented for user comments, allowing up to 3 comments per minute per user on a specific post.
- **Real-time Updates**: Notifications are handled in real-time via Kafka.
- **MongoDB**: MongoDB is used as the database to store user, post, and comment data.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have installed:

- **Node.js**: v14 or higher
- **MongoDB**: Latest version
- **Docker**: For running Kafka and Zookeeper services
- **Kafka**: For event streaming

## Project Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/social-media-api.git
cd social-media-api
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables by creating a `.env` file:

```
PORT=3000
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/social-media
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
KAFKA_BROKER_URL=localhost:9092
```

4. Run MongoDB locally or connect to a hosted MongoDB instance.

5. Start Kafka and Zookeeper using Docker:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

6. Start the server:

```bash
npm start
```

## API Endpoints

### Authentication
- **POST** `/api/users/register`: Register a new user.
- **POST** `/api/users/login`: Login and receive a JWT token.

### Posts
- **POST** `/api/posts/create`: Create a new post (Authenticated).
- **GET** `/api/posts`: Get all posts.
- **DELETE** `/api/posts/:id`: Delete a post by ID (Authenticated).

### Comments
- **POST** `/api/posts/:id/comment`: Comment on a post (Authenticated, Rate Limited).
- **GET** `/api/posts/:id/comments`: Get all comments for a post.

### Likes
- **POST** `/api/posts/:id/like`: Like or unlike a post (Authenticated).

### Notifications
- **GET** `/api/notifications`: Get all notifications for the authenticated user.

## Rate Limiting

Rate limiting is implemented using `rate-limiter-flexible`. A user can comment on a specific post no more than 3 times per minute. You can adjust this limit by modifying the `points` parameter in the rate limiter.

```javascript
const rateLimiterMiddleware = rateLimiter(3); // 3 comments per minute
```

## Kafka Integration

Kafka is used for publishing and consuming user activity events such as likes and comments. Notifications are sent in real-time when a post is liked or commented on.

- **Kafka Broker**: Kafka brokers are set up using Docker and accessed via `localhost:9092`.
- **Topics**:
  - `user_notifications`: Handles user notifications for likes and comments.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: Backend server
- **Express.js**: Routing and middleware
- **MongoDB**: Database for storing users, posts, comments, and notifications
- **JWT**: Secure token-based authentication
- **Kafka**: Event-driven architecture for notifications
- **Rate Limiting**: `rate-limiter-flexible` package for controlling user actions
- **Docker**: To run Kafka, Zookeeper, and other dependencies

## Running Tests

To run the unit tests:

```bash
npm test
```

## Future Enhancements

- **Search Functionality**: Add the ability to search for posts, users, and hashtags.
- **Direct Messaging**: Implement real-time direct messaging between users.
- **Advanced Analytics**: Track user engagement with posts using Kafka streams.
- **Caching**: Implement Redis for caching frequently accessed data like user profiles and feed data.
